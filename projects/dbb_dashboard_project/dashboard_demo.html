        <h1>Dartmouth Varsity Baseball Team</h1>
        <h2> <br> Custom Dashboard </h2>
        <h3 class = "spaced-lines"> 
            As the Data Analyst for the Dartmouth Baseball Team, I created this customized, interactive dashboard to house 
            and visualize the team's data, from scratch. I identified a need and filled it - the TrackMan UI wasn't serving our team
            well. We needed a way to visualize subsects of our data, conditioned on variables such as Pitcher, Batter, Date, Pitch Type,
            etc.  The dashboard is dynamic, the visualizations automatically update themselves as the user changes the variable selectors. <br> <br>
            I recently completed this first version, using D3.js, and R to clean and prepare the TrackMandata. A video demonstration of the dashboard 
            is imbedded into this website below. One of my objectives has been to develop resources that the team can use and update for years 
            to come â€“ I am passionate about data democratization and building user-friendly, long-lasting tools. Dartmouth 
            Baseball has never before had a team analyst, and so I have been given total creative freedom in organizing, 
            storing, analyzing, and presenting their data. It has been an invaluable and extremely enjoyable experience for me; 
            it has been very hands-on. I feel like I am working in an impactful role and my work has made tangible differences.

        <h2> <br> <br> Player Performance Reporting </h2>

        <h3 class = "spaced-lines">
            Our first main performance objective was to decrease the number of swings-and-misses, first by 
            understanding the pitches at which our batters are swinging and not making contact. I operate TrackMan to collect the data, 
            clean and process the data, and wrote functions in Python to generate zone charts with matplotlib. The functions take in parameters
            such as a list of dates, a list of batters, and an event (e.g. swing and miss), filters down the data, and outputs the associated plot,
            colored by pitch type. 
            Below are some examples:
