        <h1>Dartmouth Varsity Baseball Team</h1>
        <h2> <br> Custom Dashboard </h2>
        <h3 class = "tabbed-in"> 
            As the Data Analyst for the Dartmouth Baseball Team, I created this customized, interactive dashboard from scratch to house 
            and visualize the team's data. I identified a need and filled it - the TrackMan UI wasn't serving our team
            well. We needed a way to visualize subsects of our data, conditioned on variables such as Pitcher, Batter, Date, Pitch Type,
            etc.  The dashboard is dynamic, the visualizations automatically update themselves as the user changes the variable selectors.
            I recently completed this first version using D3.js. I also used R to clean and prepare the TrackMandata. A video demonstration of the dashboard 
            is imbedded into this website below. <br> <br> My driving goal behind any project I do for the team is to best serve the coaches and the players. 
            That includes the development of robust resources that the team can use and update for years to come, past my graduation. 
            I am very passionate about data democratization, data communication, and building user-friendly, long-lasting tools.
            One of the main benefits of creating this dashboard from scratch and in-house is that I can easily implement the coaches feedback and requests, 
            working to align the tool closely to their needs. Dartmouth Baseball has never before had a team analyst, and so I have been given total 
            creative freedom in organizing, storing, analyzing, and presenting their data. It has been an invaluable and extremely enjoyable experience for me; 
            it has been very hands-on. I feel like I am working in an impactful role and my work has made tangible differences.

        <h2> <br> <br> Player Performance Reporting </h2>

        <h3 class = "tabbed-in">
            Our first main performance objective was to decrease the number of swings-and-misses, first by understanding the pitches at 
            which our batters are swinging and not making contact. I operate TrackMan to collect the data, clean and process the data, 
            and write functions in Python to generate zone charts with matplotlib. The functions take in parameters such as a list of dates, 
            a list of batters, and an event (e.g. swing and miss), filter down the data, and output the associated plot, colored by pitch type. 
            These charts were created before my interactive dashboard. Now, with the dashboard, the coaches can generate similar charts at the 
            click of a button, and view many more metrics at a time, without needing me to write more code or prepare more data.  
            Below are some examples of these early charts:
