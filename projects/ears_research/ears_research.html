        <h1>  Earth Sciences Research Assistantship: Machine Learning and Arctic Water Tracks </h1>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            TLDR: I worked as a Earth Sciences Research Assistant in Professor Marisa Palucis's lab from June 2022 through March 2023. 
            The project I worked on was training a machine learning model to detect and label Arctic water tracks on satellite imagery. 
            Water tracks are small streams of water, running parallelly in groups off of hillslopes, as opposed to typical rivers that are meandering or braided.
            Their small size makes them difficult to distinguish and map out, leaving them underlooked.
            Both a database of mapped water tracks, and an understanding of the common characteristics and geological consequences of water tracks, would allow us to incorporate this important Arctic feature into research on water runoff.
            Water runoff is an essential metric in climate change studies because it is increased by warming global temperatures and can have major impacts on infrastructure, surrounding ecosystems, and human livelihood. <br> <br>
            To create a neural network to map water tracks on its own, I began preparing a large set of training data by by manually tracing water tracks over satellite imagery of our areas of interest: Alaska, Russia, Northern Canada, and other Arctic locations. 
            I prepared this data with Doodler, a “web application for image segmentation”. I began the process of machine learning with Segmentation Gym, an application that feeds the neural network training data. 
            At the end of my research term, I presented my findings on optimizing data collection, labeling, and training to the professors in the department.
