        <h1>  QSS 30 Course: Sports Analytics </h1>
        <h2> Term Project </h2>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            TLDR: This past semester I took Dartmouthâ€™s sports analytics course. For our final project, 
            my group decided to do a Markov Chain analysis of the College Football Overtime structure
            to determine if there was an inherent benefit in, after winning the coin toss, deferring
            the ball and setting up on defense first. We set up a matrix to represent the Markov Chain
            - the states were defined by the game situation (possession, score, overtime period, 
            and frame of the overtime (going first or responding)). We then ran the matrix through 
            the PyMC library and analyzed historical play-by-play data in R to find the transition 
            probabilities from state to state, which were based on average touchdown success rate, 
            field goal success rate, two-point conversion rate, etc, across the Power Five since the overtime 
            structure rule change. We found that, between two evenly ranked teams regarding scoring success rates, 
            the team that goes second has a 51% chance of winning the game.
