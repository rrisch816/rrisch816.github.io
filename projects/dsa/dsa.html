        <h2> Dartmouth Sports Analytics Club (DSA) Sloan Research Competition: <br>
            The Effect of Managerial Ejections on Game Score</h2>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            TLDR: I conducted Mann-Whitney U tests in Python to determine whether managerial ejections in Major League Baseball influence game score by analyzing 31,000 games and 2,600 ejections from 2011â€“2024. My data was sourced from Retrosheet and cleaned/wrangled in R.
            I set up tests by the inning in which each ejection occurred and the associated game state (all, losing, and tied at time of ejection). 
            Most ejection scenarios show no statistically significant effect on score changes, yet there were a few that yielded statistically significant results: early-game (2nd inning), tied mid-game (3rd or 5th inning), and late-game (8th inning) ejections have measurable effects, often suggesting momentum shifts or rallying effects for the ejectee's team.
            This paper also includes a general, comprehensive report on the statistics of ejections, such as frequency distributions and ejection effect visualizations.
            <br> <br> This project won the annual Dartmouth Sports Analytics Club Research Competition, and I received a ticket to the 2025 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference as a prize!
