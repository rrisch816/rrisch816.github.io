        <h2> <br> TLDR: </h2>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            The goal of this project is to build out a global hydrologic history of Mars. With an extensive database of craters, which includes crater location, depth, and diameter, 
            and a global geologic map, which provides approximate crater age, we can reverse equations created by Smith et al. to estimate erosion rates across 
            the globe and throughout geologic history. With local erosion rates, considering latitude, we can decide whether the area (and time period) was dominated by either 
            glacial or fluvial hydrologic surface processes. Erosion rates are used as a proxy for amount of water. The presence of water on Mars is a generational scientific discovery, 
            and we want to answer more specific questions about it. Doing so will allow us to understand more about the geologic history of Earth, because a lot of surface history is lost 
            to recycling plate tectonics. It will also inform specific target locations for future manned missions to Mars, because astronauts will need a water source.
