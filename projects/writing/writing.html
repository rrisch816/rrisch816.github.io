        <h2> REL 61 (Religion and the Civil Rights Movement) Final Paper </h2>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            TLDR: This paper examines how themes of redemptive suffering, divine justice, and respectability politics shaped the American Civil Rights Movement, arguing that while they empowered perseverance, they also inadvertently slowed progress by aligning with calls for restraint and conformity.

        <h2> <br> NAIS 25 (Indian Country Today) Final Paper </h2>
        <h3 class="tabbed-in">
            TLDR: This paper argues that the federal government should encourage and financially incentivize Native American tribes to independently operate their healthcare systems, highlighting how tribal-led health services, as exemplified by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, lead to better health outcomes, cultural competence, and community satisfaction compared to the chronically underfunded and mismanaged Indian Health Service.
